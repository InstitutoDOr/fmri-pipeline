X_01/C_01 is a standard block design
X_02/C_01 is the same block design but with no ISI
X_03/C_01 is the same block design but with no ISI and no initial fixation
X_04/C_01 is the same design as X_01 but R1 and R2 are highly correlated (shifted by 1 TR)
X_05/C_01 is the same design as X_01 but R1 and R2 are completely correlated (R2 is exact copy of R1)

X_06/C_01 is a Slow Event Related design (ISI: 12 s) that lasts as long as X_01 (so of course it has many fewer trials!)
X_07/C_01 is a Slow Event Related design (ISI: 12 s) with as many total events as X_01 (so of course it's much longer!)
X_08/C_01 is a Slow Event Related design but with half the ISI than other SER designs (i.e., ISI: 6s)

X_09/C_01 is identical to X_06, but Regs 2 and 3 are correlated (3 is a 1-shiftet 2)
X_10/C_01 is identical to X_06, but Regs 2 and 3 are correlated (3 is an exact copy of 2)
